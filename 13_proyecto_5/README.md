This project is a simulation of a digital banking application, developed as a
practice exercise to apply frontend development knowledge, validations, business
logic, and professional structure.

The application allows users to simulate common banking operations such as
login, registration, transfers, loans, and bill payments, all in a safe
environment without real storage or backend connection.

> ⚠️ This system is **for educational and practice purposes only**. All data is
> temporary and will not persist after a reload.

## 🧩 Project Goals

- Simulate the real flow of a banking application from the user's point of view.
- Design a scalable modular structure using development best practices.
- Apply validations, state management, and internal logic without relying on a
  backend.
- Document the functional and technical flow as in a real professional
  environment.

## ✨ Key Features

- Login with simulated users
- Registration of new test users
- Bank card view with hidden data
- Money transfers between accounts (with currency conversion if needed)
- Loan requests with automatic interest calculation
- Sortable transaction history
- Bill payments with balance validation
- Logout from any screen
- Simulated data loading (using `setTimeout`)
- Modularity and separation of logic and presentation
