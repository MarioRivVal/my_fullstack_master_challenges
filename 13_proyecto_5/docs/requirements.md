### Requirements Analysis for Simulated Banking Application

#### **1. Introduction**

**System Objective:**  
This project aims to develop a web application that simulates basic
functionalities of a banking app, allowing users to perform common operations
such as transfers, balance inquiries, expense logging, and loan requests.  
The project is intended for learning purposes and does not include a backend, so
all generated data will be temporary and lost upon page reload.

**Scope:**  
The application is designed to be used by testers to interact with a set of
predefined users and a temporary user that can be created during the session.
Testers can switch between accounts to verify that transactions have been
processed correctly.  
It does not include database integration or complex features of a real banking
system.

#### **2. Functional Requirements**

1. The application will allow login using predefined user credentials (username
   and password).
2. Testers will be able to create a temporary user, which will only be available
   during the active session.
3. Users will be able to view their personal data, including username and
   password.
4. Transfers of money between available accounts will be possible.
5. Users will be able to log expenses by selecting a category and amount.
6. The application will display a list of all money inflows and outflows,
   including transfers and recorded expenses.
7. Users will be able to request simulated loans from an imaginary bank.
8. A specific section will be implemented to simulate loan requests.

---

#### **3. Non-Functional Requirements**

1. The application will be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile
   devices.
2. The system will be available in English only.
3. All functionalities will be implemented visually, without backend
   integration.
4. Each feature will be located on an independent page to facilitate navigation.
5. The app includes an "info" tab, accessible at any time to view instructions
   and predefined user credentials.

---

#### **4. Assumptions and Constraints**

1. Data generated by the temporary user and its interactions will be lost upon
   page reload.
2. Predefined users will be:

   - User 1: `mari`, Password: `1111`
   - User 2: `anfe`, Password: `2222`
   - User 3: `luwr`, Password: `3333`

3. Transfers, expenses, and loan requests will be entirely simulated with no
   real processing.
4. Advanced data validation (e.g., password format checking) will not be
   implemented.

---

#### **5. Actors and User Profiles**

- **Tester:**  
  A person who interacts with the application by logging in with predefined
  users or creating a temporary user.  
  The tester will test the simulated functionalities to verify the proper
  behavior of the system.

#### **6. Initial Use Cases**

1. **UC01 - View System Information:**

   - When launching the app, the system displays a modal with instructions and
     predefined user credentials.  
     The tester can access this information again at any time by clicking the
     "Info" button.

2. **UC02 - Log In:**

   - The tester enters the credentials of a predefined user to access the
     system.

3. **UC03 - Create Temporary User:**

   - The tester can create a temporary user by providing first name, last name,
     and password.  
     The default initial balance will be 10,000 for testing purposes.  
     This user will be removed when the page is reloaded.

4. **UC04 - View Personal Data:**

   - The tester views the personal data of the currently logged-in user.

5. **UC05 - Transfer Money:**

   - The tester performs a money transfer between available accounts.

6. **UC06 - Pay a Bill:**

   - The tester selects an expense category and logs an amount, which appears in
     the transaction list.

7. **UC07 - Show Transactions:**

   - The tester views a list of all positive and negative transactions, with
     respective sums and deductions.

8. **UC08 - Request a Loan:**

   - The tester simulates a loan request by entering the desired amount and
     repayment terms.

9. **UC09 - Log Out:**
   - The tester can log out at any time, returning to the login screen.
